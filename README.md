## Description

*Tiles Explorer* is an iOS helper app for Explorer Tiles.
The explorer tiles are based on OpenStreetMap 256x256px tiles on zoom level 14.

What is the point of explorer tiles? Explore the map with your workouts and get the biggest possible square and visit as many tiles as you can!
Check out [VeloViewer](https://blog.veloviewer.com/veloviewer-explorer-score-and-max-square/) for further information.

*Tiles Explorer* will help you to keep track of your explored tiles. 
The app covers a map with tiles. There are three tile types (explored, not explored, marked). You can pick which types should be displayed on the map.
Explored tiles are tiles you visited during a workout. They are imported with the iOS app *Workout Map*.
You can also see your current position to check which tile you are currently in and to estimate the distance to the next tile.
There is an option to mark tiles. This can help to keep track which tiles you want to visit next.

Select a color for each tile type (explored, not explored, marked) to visualise your tiles.
To mark a tile, just click any and use the star button on the map.

*Tiles Explorer* shares its database with [Workout Map](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workoutmap/id1608785584) to display your visited tiles which were part of a workout.
Import your explored tiles directly from *Apple Health* with *Workout Map*.


For the best performance, only a certain amount of tiles are displayed at once. You might need to zoom in on the map to show the tiles.
When moving around the map, it takes a moment to display the tiles for the new visible area on the map.
