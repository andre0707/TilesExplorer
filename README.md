#  Tiles Explorer

Tiles Explorer is an iOS helper app for Explorer Tiles.
The Explorer Tiles are based on OpenStreetMap 256x256px tiles on zoom level 14.

What is the point? Get the biggest possible square and visit as many tiles as you can!
Check out [VeloViewer](https://blog.veloviewer.com/veloviewer-explorer-score-and-max-square/) for further information.

Tiles Explorer will cover the map with the tiles. You can also see your current position.

Tiles Explorer shares its database with [Workout Map](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workoutmap/id1608785584) to display your visited tiles.

There is also an option to mark a tile. Just click on it and use the star button on the right side of the screen.

Tiles Explorer lets you help find new tiles around you.


For the best performance, only a certain amount of tiles are displayed at once. You might need to zoom in on the map to show the tiles.
When moving around on the map, it takes a moment to display the tiles for the new visible area on the map.
